## Features / Motivation

I wanted to have a custom window title for the [(default / built-in) New Tab page in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/about-new-tab-page).

Unfortunately there is no option for that in Firefox and I found no existing Add-on which already provides such functionality, so here is one.

### What it does

On the Add-on options page a custom title can be defined, this title will then be applied to the New Tab page.

Please note: It will be applied to the window title, not the tab title (by default the title bar is hidden in Firefox, but e.g. on Windows the window title is still the one used on the taskbar).
